## Project Overview

Football is a global sport with a massive following, and FIFA is a popular football simulation game. This project focuses on analyzing player data from FIFA 15 to FIFA 20, aiming to gain insights into player attributes, performance trends, and positional skills. The main tasks of the project are as follows:

1. **Data Analysis and Exploration**: Perform data loading, cleaning, and exploratory analysis to understand the dataset's structure and characteristics.

2. **Football Skills Clustering**: Cluster players based on their attributes to identify groups of similar players with distinct skills.

3. **Specific Questions Analysis**: Address specific questions related to player statistics, such as the top countries producing players, age vs. performance, and earnings based on player positions.

4. **Model Comparison**: Compare the performance of various machine learning models on the data and recommend the best model for potential predictive tasks.

5. **Challenges Faced**: Document challenges encountered during data analysis and the techniques used to overcome them.

## Task Breakdown

### Data Analysis and Exploration

- Load the dataset ("players_20.csv").
- Clean the data by handling missing values, data types, and transformations.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand attribute distributions, correlations, and trends.

### Football Skills Clustering

- Utilize relevant attributes to cluster players based on their skills.
- Apply appropriate clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to group players with similar attributes.
- Visualize the clusters to gain insights into player types and skill profiles.

### Specific Questions Analysis

1. **Top Countries with Most Players**:
   - Prepare a ranked list of the top 10 countries with the most players.
   - Determine which countries are producing the most footballers playing at a high level.

2. **Age vs. Performance**:
   - Plot the distribution of overall rating vs. age of players.
   - Interpret the age after which a player's performance improvement seems to plateau.

3. **Earnings by Player Positions**:
   - Analyze and compare the earnings of different offensive positions (striker, right-winger, left-winger).
   - Determine which position tends to receive higher pay.

### Model Comparison

- Compare the performance of different machine learning models on the dataset.
- Evaluate models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score) and visualize the results.
- Recommend the best-performing model for potential production use.

### Challenges Faced

- Document challenges encountered during data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling.
- Describe the techniques, strategies, or tools used to address these challenges.
- Reflect on the lessons learned and insights gained from overcoming challenges.

## Project Deliverables

- Jupyter Notebook containing all code, analysis, visualizations, and model comparisons.
- Written report summarizing the project objectives, methods, findings, and recommendations.
- README file providing an overview of the project, tasks, and structure.

## Conclusion

The FIFA 20 Data Analysis project aims to extract valuable insights from player data, answer important questions, and evaluate machine learning models for predictive tasks. Through systematic analysis and interpretation, this project contributes to a deeper understanding of football player attributes and performance trends in the FIFA video game series.
